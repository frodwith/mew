do sensible things when the ultimate prototype is not a Mew object
    $obj->{key} should work if the prototype is really a blessed hash 
        with a caveat that relying on this would break encapsulation,
        but providing the functionality anyways for completeness
    $obj->method should work if the prototype can('method').
 
more tests (isa.t, can.t with foreign objects)

docs
    * mention that UNIVERSAL methods can screw with you
    * talk about problems using the tied-hash syntax during the global
      destruction phase
